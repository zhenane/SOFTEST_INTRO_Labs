Feature: UsingCalculatorAvailability
In order to calculate MTBF and Availability
As someone who struggles with maths
I want to be able to use my calculator to do this

Scenario: Calculating MTBF
Given I have a calculator
When I have entered 1000 and 4 into the calculator and press MTBF
Then the result should be 250

Scenario: Calculating Availability
Given I have a calculator
When I have entered 200 and 50 into the calculator and press Availability
Then the result should be 0.8

Scenario: Calculating Availability from named reliability values
Given I have a calculator
And the reliability values are
| MTBF | MTTR |
| 90 | 10 |
When I calculate Availability from these values
Then the result should be 0.9

Scenario Outline: Reject invalid MTBF inputs
Given I have a calculator
When I have entered <hours> and <failures> into the calculator and press MTBF
Then the calculation should be rejected
Examples:
| hours | failures |
| 1000 | 0 |
| 0 | 4 |

Scenario Outline: Reject invalid Availability inputs
Given I have a calculator
When I have entered <mtbf> and <mttr> into the calculator and press Availability
Then the calculation should be rejected
Examples:
| mtbf | mttr |
| -1 | 10 |
| 10 | -1 |
| 0 | 0 |
